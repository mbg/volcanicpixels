        than welcome to use it and the products distributed through it. All we

        The long version
        ----------------


        ### 1. Introduction

        The following terms and conditions govern use of the Volcanic 
        Pixels website or the products distributed on it (the "Service"). The 
        website is wholly owned and operated by Platinum Mirror LTD ("Platinum 
        Mirror", "We", "Us"). By using the Service you agree to these terms in 
        full. If you disagree with these terms, You must not use this service.

        You must be at least 13 years of age to use this Service. By using 
        the Service, you warrant and represent that you are at least 13 years
        of age.


        ### 2. License to use the Service

        Unless otherwise stated, We own the intellectual property rights to 
        the Service and all code contained within it. We reserve the right to 
        refuse the Service to any user.


        ### 3. Warranty Disclaimer

        We make no warrant of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory or 
        otherwise, including without limitation, merchantability fitness for a 
        particular use and noninfringement. The service is provided by Us and 
        Our Licensors "as is" and "as available". You assume all risk for your 
        use of the Service, including without limitation any harm caused by 
        viruses, works, or other damaging materials.


        ### 4. Law and jurisdiction

        These terms of use will be governed by and construed in accordance 
        with English law, and any disputes relating to these terms of use will 
        be subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England 
        and Wales.

        All payments are final and non-refundable, except at Our sole 
        discretion.


        ### 6. Severability

        If a provision of these terms of use is determined by any court or 
        other competent authority to be unlawful and/or unenforceable, the 
        other provisions will continue in effect. If any unlawful and/or 
        unenforceable provision would be lawful or enforceable if part of it 
        were deleted, that part will be deemed to be deleted, and the rest of 
        the provision will continue in effect.
        

        ### 7. Breaches of these terms of service

        Without prejudice to Our other rights under these terms of use, if

        we deem appropriate to deal with the breach, including suspending Your 
        access to the Service, prohibiting You from accessing the Service, 
        blocking computers using Your IP address from accessing the Service, 
        contacting Your internet service provider to request that they block 
        Your access to the Service and/or bringing court proceedings against 
        You.
