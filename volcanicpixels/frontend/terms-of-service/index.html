        ### 2. License to use the Service

        Unless otherwise stated, We own the intellectual property rights to 
        the Service and all code contained within it. We reserve the right to 
        refuse the Service to any user.


        ### 3. Warranty Disclaimer

        We make no warrant of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory or 
        otherwise, including without limitation, merchantability fitness for a 
        particular use and noninfringement. The service is provided by Us and 
        Our Licensors "as is" and "as available". You assume all risk for your 
        use of the Service, including without limitation any harm caused by

        ### 4. Law and jurisdiction

        These terms of use will be governed by and construed in accordance 
        with English law, and any disputes relating to these terms of use will 
        be subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England 
        and Wales.


        ### 5. Refunds

        All payments are final and non-refundable, except at Our sole 
        discretion.


        ### 6. Severability

        If a provision of these terms of use is determined by any court or 
        other competent authority to be unlawful and/or unenforceable, the 
        other provisions will continue in effect. If any unlawful and/or 
        unenforceable provision would be lawful or enforceable if part of it 
        were deleted, that part will be deemed to be deleted, and the rest of 
        the provision will continue in effect.


        ### 7. SSL Certificate Subscriber Agreement

        #### 7.1 Definitions

        **"Certificate Application"** means a request to a CA for the issuance 
        of a Certificate. 

        **"Certificate Authority"** or **"CA"** means an entity authorized to 
        issue, suspend, or revoke Certificates. For purposes of this 
        Agreement, CA shall mean Comodo. 


        ### 7.2 Use and Restrictions

        You may install the Certificate only on servers that are accessible 
        at the domain(s) listed in the Certificate. You are prohibited from 
        using your Certificate;

        - (i) for or on behalf of any other organization;
        - (ii) to perform private or public key operations in connection with 
        any domain and/or organization name other than the one you submitted 
        on your Certificate Application; and
        - (iii) with control equipment in hazardous circumstances or 
        for uses requiring fail-safe performance such as the operation of 
        nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, 
        air traffic control systems, or weapons control systems, where 
        failure could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe 
        environmental damage. If you are using the Licensed Certificate 
        Option, you acknowledge and agree that this option can result in 
        increased security risks to your network and that both We and Comodo 
        expressly disclaims any liability for breaches of security that result 
        from the distribution of a single key across multiple devices.


        ### 7.3 Reporting and Revocation

        If you discover or have reason to believe there has been a compromise 
        of your private key, or the information within your Certificate is, 
        or has become, incorrect or inaccurate, or if your organization name 
        and/or domain name registration has changed, you must immediately 
        cease using the Certificate and its associated private key, and you 
        must notify Comodo (or Us, and we will notify Comodo on your 
        behalf). If We or Comodo discovers or has reason to believe that 
        there has been a compromise of your private key or misuse of your 
        Certificate, you must respond to Our or Comodo's instructions 
        within the time specified. Both Volcanic Pixels and Comodo retains 
        the right to revoke your Certificate at any time without notice if;

        - (i) we discover that the information within your Certificate is no 
        longer valid;
        - (ii) you violate or fail to perform your obligations under the 
        terms of this Agreement; or 
        - (iii) Comodo determines in its sole discretion that the continued 
        use of your Certificate may compromise the security or integrity of 
        the CA. We may also revoke your Certificate for non-payment.


        ### 7.4 Comodo Representations and Warranties

        Comodo represents and warrants that

        - (i) there are no errors introduced by Comodo in the Certificate 
        information as a result of Comodo's failure to use reasonable care 
        in creating the Certificate;
        - (ii) its issuance of Certificates shall comply in all material 
        respects with its CPS; and
        - (iii) its revocation services and use of a Repository conform to 
        its CPS in all material aspects. 


        ### 8. Breaches of these terms of service

        Without prejudice to Our other rights under these terms of use, if 
        You breach these terms of use in any way, we may take such action as 
        we deem appropriate to deal with the breach, including suspending Your 
        access to the Service, prohibiting You from accessing the Service, 
        blocking computers using Your IP address from accessing the Service, 
        contacting Your internet service provider to request that they block

        You.
