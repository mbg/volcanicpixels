        Privacy Policy
        ==============

        In short, we only collect and use information that will help make our 
        products and services better. We never share any of your data unless 
        absolutely necessary (for example, preventing fraud, when providing a 
        service from a third party or when legally compelled to).

        ***


        The long version
        ----------------

        At Volcanic Pixels (the "Website", the "Service", Us", "We") We collect 
        and manage consumer data in accordance with this policy. If you have 
        any questions or comments regarding this Privacy Policy or its 
        enforcement then please contact us at <hello@platinummirror.com>.

        ### Information we collect and use
        
        We collect anonymous data from every visitor of the Website to monitor 
        traffic and fix bugs. For example, We collect information like IP 
        addresses, browser version, timestamp, page accessed.

        ### How We use your data

        We may use your personal information to:  
        
         - administer the website
         - improve your experience of the site by personalising the website
         - send statements and invoices to you
         - collect payments from you
         - send you general (non-marketing) communications
         - send you email notifications which you have explitly opted-in to
         - deal with enquiries or complaints
         - keep the website secure and prevent fraud
         - list you in the "Customers" section (we will remove you upon request)
         - action orders with third parties on your behalf

        ## Collecting Payment

        Our current payment provider is Stripe. When you enter your credit 
        card details they are sent encrypted to Stripe and stored in a PCI 
        compliant environment. Your credit card information is never sent to,
        let alone stored on our servers.

        ## SSL orders

        When you make an SSL order with us your details are sent securely to
        the certificate issuer and are used by them in accordance with their 
        own privacy policy. Volcanic Pixels routinely verifies that this policy 
        provides adequate provisions for the privacy of our users and in 
        the event that it does not we will no longer use that provider and 
        request that they remove all customer data.

        ### Changes to this policy

        We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information 
        We collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time 
        such information is used. If We make major changes in the way We collect 
        or use your information then We will notify you by posting an announcement 
        on the website or sending you an email.
