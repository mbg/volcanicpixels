        Security
        ========

        In short, we use industry standard security measures to keep your data 
        safe. We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities 
        and reward people for doing so.

        ***

        The long version
        ----------------

        ### Physical Security

         - Data center access is limited to Google Data Center technicians.
         - Security personnel are present 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
         - Files are stored with random file names and not in plain text so 
           they are not humanly readable.
         - When hard drives reach the end of their life they are crushed and 
           shredded.


        ### System security

         - Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) mitigation services
         - No one has root access (VM instance are immutable, they can only be
           created and destroyed)

        ### Responsible disclosure

        If you have found a security vulnerability please contact us at 
        <hello@platinummirror.com>. Please act in good faith towards our 
        users' privacy and data during your disclosure.
