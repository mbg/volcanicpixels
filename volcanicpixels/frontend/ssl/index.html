                    <h1>Not just App Engine</h1>
                    <p>We are currently targeting App Engine users, however we provide both the App Engine formatted certificates and the unformatted ones so <span class="highlight">our certificates can be used on any server</span>. So if you move away from App Engine or you aren't using it to start with then we can still deliver.</p>
                    <small>We don't currently provide "helping you setup" support for websites not hosted on App Engine, ask your hosting provider instead.</small>

        <div class="questions">
            <p>
                <h3>Which certificate authority signs the certificates?</h3>
                Currently the root certificate authorities we use are subsidiaries of Symantec and Comodo
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>Can I upload my own CSR?</h3>
                Yes you can: <a>Upload a CSR</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>Who does your payments?</h3>
                Our payment provider is <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>. Your credit card info is never sent to our servers. If you want to know more about how this works please <a href="mailto:hello@volcanicpixels.com">email us</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>Do you provide wildcard certificates?</h3>
                Wildcard certificates are much more expensive so unless you need more than 5 sub domains they are not economical. If you do need this then <a href="mailto:hello@volcanicpixels.com">get in touch</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>Do you provide extended verification certificates?</h3>
                Yes, just <a href="mailto:hello@volcanicpixels.com">ping us an email</a> and we will tell you how much it will cost. <small>(we are working on integrating it into  the purchase form)</small>
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>I have a different question.</h3>
                We love hearing from people, send an email to <a href="mailto:hello@volcanicpixels.com">hello@<volcanicpixels class="com"></volcanicpixels></a>
